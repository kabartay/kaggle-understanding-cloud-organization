Climate change has been at the top of our minds and at the forefront of important political decision-making for many years. Classification of different types of clouds is substantial
for understanding climate change. Human ability to identify patterns is limited and murky boundaries between different forms of clouds lead to obstacles in traditional rule-based algorithms cloud features separation. In these situations, machine learning techniques, particularly deep learning, have demonstrated their ability to mimic the human capacity for identifying patterns in the clouds using satellite images. This work focuses on segmentation of four subjective patterns of clouds organization: Sugar, Flower, Fish, Gravel.
